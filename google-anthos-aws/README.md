# How to install Ondat on a Google Anthos deployed on AWS
**NOTE**: Although the following solution is fairly simple to implement, we advise you to engage with our Customer Success Team due to the specifics of such deployment from a k8s cluster standpoint.

Once a fully deployed and accessible Google Anthos k8s is deployed on AWS, Ondat can be installed using the ```kubectl storageos``` plugin. 

Reference: get the plugin [here](https://github.com/storageos/kubectl-storageos) or follow the ondat documentation [here](https://docs.ondat.io/v2.5/docs/install/kubernetes/#install-the-storageos-kubectl-plugin).

What is included in this folder:  
- ```ondat-etcd.yaml```: the configuration file for the Ondat etcd
- ```ondat-cluster.yaml```: the Ondat cluster configuration file 
- ```test-dep-rwo.yaml```: a read-write-once deployment test
- ```test-dep-rwx.yaml```: a read-write-many deployment test 

## installation
On the admin host from which the Google Anthos k8s on AWS is accessible, run the following: 

```shell
kubectl storageos install --include-etcd --etcd-cluster-yaml ondat-etcd.yaml --etcd-namespace storageos --stos-cluster-yaml ondat-cluster.yaml --stos-cluster-namespace storageos --stos-version v2.5.0
```

Let's have a look at the parameters:
- ```--include-etcd```: deploy the Ondat etcd within the k8s cluster
- ```--etcd-cluster-yaml ondat-etcd.yaml```: overwrite the default plugin parameters with the one from the configuration file 
- ```--etcd-namespace storageos```: overwrite the default plugin parameters to deploy the etcd cluster within a custom namespace
- ```--stos-cluster-yaml ondat-cluster.yaml```: overwrite the default plugin parameters with the one from this configuration file
- ```--stos-cluster-namespace storageos```: overwrite the default plugin parameters to deploy the Ondat cluster within a custom namespace
- ```--stos-version v2.5.0```: overwrite the default plugin parameters with the desired version

**NOTE**:  
- Do not change this two files, ```ondat-etcd.yaml``` and ```ondat-cluster.yaml```! This files have been tuned for the deployment of Ondat on google anthos k8s running on aws. 
- If customization is required, engage with the Ondat Customer Success Team.

Once the installation is done, the following outcome of ```kubectl get pod -n storageos```
 should be expected:

## Test with a RWO volume
This test will perform the following:
- create a ```PersistentVolumeClaim``` 
- create a ```Deployment``` calling for the ```PersistentVolumeCLaim``` that will attach the ```PersistentVolume``` to the defined path ```/mnt/```. 

In this context, a read-write-once or rwo persitent volume is created. This volume can only be attached to one pod at a time. 

**NOTE**: for an easier comparison between the RWO and RWX volume, this example use a ```Deployment``` type instead of a ```StatefulSet``` type of workload deployment. It is recommended to deploy any stateful application using a RWO volume with a ```StatefulSet``` deployment type to ensure order in operations. See the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/) for more details.

The file ```test1-dep-rwo.yaml``` as two section; one to create a ```PersistentVolumeClaim``` using the default Ondat ```StorageClass``` and one to create a deployment for a simple debian container calling the ```PersistenVolumeClaim```.

Here is the contain: 
```YAML

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: pvc-rwo
spec:
  storageClassName: storageos
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce

      storage: 5Gi
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment

  labels:
    app: app-rwo
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: app-rwo
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: app-rwo
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: debian
          image: debian:9-slim
          command: ["/bin/sleep"]
          args: [ "3600" ]
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /mnt/
              name: v1
      volumes:
        - name: v1
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: pvc-rwo
```

**NOTE**: the replicas count for the deployment is set to 1. This means 1 pod will be deployed accessing 1 volume. If the replicas count for the deployment is set to 3, 3 pods will be scheduled with 1 volume for each pod resulting in 3 volumes being provisioned. 

To deploy, the following command has to be executed: 
```
kubectl apply -f test1-dep-rwo.yaml
```

To verify the status, run the following command:
```
kubectl get pod
kubectl get pvc
```


## Test with a RWX volume
This test will perform the following:
- create a ```PersistentVolumeClaim``` 
- create a ```Deployment``` calling for the ```PersistentVolumeCLaim``` that will attach the ```PersistentVolume``` to the defined path ```/mnt/```. 

In this context, a read-write-many or rwx persitent volume is created. This volume can be attached to multiple pods at a time. 

The file ```test1-dep-rwx.yaml``` as two section; one to create a ```PersistentVolumeClaim``` using the default Ondat ```StorageClass``` and one to create a deployment for a simple debian container calling the ```PersistenVolumeClaim```.

Here is the contain: 
```YAML
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: pvc-rwx
spec:
  storageClassName: storageos
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app-rwx
  labels:
    app: app-rwx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: app-rwx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: app-rwx
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: debian
          image: debian:9-slim
          command: ["/bin/sleep"]
          args: [ "3600" ]
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /mnt/
              name: v1
      volumes:
        - name: v1
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: pvc-rwx

```

**NOTE**: the replicas count for the deployment is set to 3. This means 3 pod will be deployed accessing 1 volume. If the replicas count for the deployment is set to 6, 6 pods will be scheduled still accessing the same 1 volume. This is the major difference with a rwo volume.  

To deploy, the following command has to be executed: 
```
kubectl apply -f test1-dep-rwx.yaml
```
To verify the status, run the following command:
```
kubectl get pod
kubectl get pvc
```
